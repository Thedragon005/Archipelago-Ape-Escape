## What does randomization do to this game?

```
Spike!

This is the professor, Specter is at it again! The monkeys stole everybody's items and went away through time!
What's worse? Specter locked each era with a key and you need to find all of them to travel to the next era ! 

I'm counting on you, please help everyone get their items back!

Go Ape and catch Specter !
```

Specter felt that Ape Escape is a pretty linear game, so he locked each era behind an item called "World Key".

The game unlocks 3 levels (one world) 
at the start of the game. After each "World Key" is collected, the next 3 levels are unlocked.
This allows for a much less linear experience.

Progression is also blocked by not having your normally unlocked gadgets, 
since some levels/monkeys require a combination of gadgets to access
## What items and locations get shuffled?

Items that are shuffled are the gadgets normally acquired thought the tutorial levels and 6 "World Keys" which are there to limit progression further.
Stun Club can also be shuffled or replaced by another starting gadget for more complex logic.

The Monkeys you catch and
certain level bosses count as locations, with the possibility to add more in future versions.

Specters coins are optional locations that are disabled by default,
you can activate them in the options.



## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

There is also filler items to compensate for the lack of items compared to locations

## What does another world's item look like in Ape Escape?

There is currently no way to tell apart other world's items and your own items

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

You will be able to see the change directly in game (In the pause menu) or by checking the Bizhawk client
